            <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
            <p><strong>Discord Server Data:</strong> We only store Discord server (guild) IDs, channel IDs, and webhook URLs that you explicitly configure for receiving game news and updates.</p>
            <p><strong>Command Usage:</strong> When you use slash commands, we temporarily process the command data to fulfill your request, but we don't store personal user data.</p>
            <p><strong>Log Data:</strong> Basic error logs are maintained for troubleshooting purposes, but these don't include personal information beyond Discord identifiers.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <p><strong>Delivering Game Updates:</strong> The stored channel and webhook information is used exclusively to deliver game news and release notifications to your chosen Discord channels.</p>
            <p><strong>Bot Functionality:</strong> Server IDs are used to associate your Discord server with your game tracking preferences.</p>
            <p><strong>Improvement:</strong> Anonymous usage statistics help us understand which features are most valuable to users.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Data We Don't Collect</h2>
            <p>GameWatcher <strong>does not</strong> collect or store:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Personal user data beyond Discord's public identifiers</li>
                <li>Message content from your server</li>
                <li>IP addresses or geolocation data</li>

            <h2>Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
            <p><strong>No Third-Party Sharing:</strong> We don't share any collected data with third parties except for the database host that stores the bot's operational data.</p>
            <p><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose data in response to valid legal obligations, though this is highly unlikely given the minimal data we store.</p>
            <p><strong>No Sale of Data:</strong> We do not and will never sell any collected data.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Data Retention and Security</h2>

            <p><strong>Security:</strong> We use standard security practices to protect the minimal data we store.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>User Rights and Choices</h2>
